    <h1>API DEVELOPEMENT</h1>
    <h2>Repository name : API</h2>
    <p>the architectural style of REST will be used to completer this section of the semesters project .An API will seerve sa the communicate of to the seerver and frontend which would be done in project 2 .The API will be used as a data source to manage interaction with the data source</p>
    <h2>General requirements</h2>
    <p>The API should contain at least one get, post, patch and delete method per
resource â€“ aligning to the project's requirements. The RESTful API architecture has several
endpoints called over HTTP, invoking application code to update a database. </p>
Project 3 -> Project-3 repo
    <h1>MVC Web Application</h1>
    <h2>Repository name : MVC Web Application</h2>
    <p>I believe a brief recap of the .Net Core programing language is required and that will aid vastly in the understanding of the preexisting project that we will be given and help advance in</p>
    <h2>General requirements</h2>
    <p>Functional requirements refer to the functionality that a system must have. The RESTful API architecture has several
endpoints called over HTTP, invoking application code to update a database.These non-functional requirements
are deemed as supportive requirements to ensure that the functional requirements are
implemented appropriately and according to good software practices. </p>

this project will have to connected to project 2 

Project 4 -> Project-4 repo
<h1>Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</h1>
    <h2>Repository name : Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</h2>
    <p>this project will be used to automate the functionalty of testing the user experience of the combine product of project 1-2 .This will help better understan to be cappablities and scalablity of the produict be realese into production and fined better ways to archieve the desied task  </p>

# Braching strategy
I have chosen to use the Github Flow 
<img src = "/github-flow-branching-model.jpeg"></img>
<br>
Github Flow focuses on Agile principles and so it is a fast and streamlined branching strategy with short production cycles and frequent releases. 
it will allow for  testing and automating changes to a single branch instead of a development branch, rapid and continuous deployment is possible which will be very useful for the production of this whole . According to my research this branching stategy is suited small teams and web applications and it is ideal when you need to maintain a single production version.
